# Age-Of-Nomrial
A greenfoot java project, where your role is to prevent enemies from breaching the wall by ensuring castle hp never hits 0. You will start out as a lone archer, firing arrows at enemies. As waves continue to pass, you may receive help
from wizards that'll help with relieving you of some pressure when fighting off the hordes of enemies. As the waves continue, the quantity of enemies will increase, and different types of enemies will be introduced, which may require you
to react fast to their corresponding danger. May your resolve for Nomrial never waver.
